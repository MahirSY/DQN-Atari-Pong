# Machine Learning Nano Degree Capstone Project: Deep Reinforcement Learning to train an agent to play Atari Pong game using DQN

I have obtained the starter code from CS 294: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Spring 2017

https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework/tree/master/sp17_hw/hw3

Make sure Tensorflow and OpenAI Gym 

Run the training using the following command

```python run_dqn_atari.py >> train_logs_new.log```


There is a jupyter notebook which has all the code for plotting the stats presented in the report.
